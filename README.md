# CNN Deep-Feature Extraction
This repository holds scripts to train and extract deep features from convolutional neural networks using pytorch. 

Check out the example scripts for training networks or to extracting values from layers.

Besides the examples are three other scripts that are used to manage and distribute code. They are:

Dataset.py: Holds ImageDataset class that handles opening files, transforming them and other stuff;
FileHandling.py: Functions to deal with files like creating a csv file with a folder contents and creating a .arff file
CNN.py: Function to train neural networks
